# It's time to code! - fMRI python analysis 

Team contributors: Lynn Valeyry Verty

![Time to code](giphy_code.gif)


## Summary 


I'm a first year PhD student in neuropsychology at University of Montreal. With BHS, I wish to learn more about python for fMRI data analysis. I especially wish to be better at automatizing my scripts with function definition in python. 
.

## Project definition 

### Background

My project is on aging and cognitive training. Not sure yet if I want to use the data from my thesis project or open data ressources. 

### Tools 

I want to learn more about these tools :
 
 * Python libraries of statistics and visualization (Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, Seaborn, ...)
 * Git/Github
 
Also, I really want to be able to create functions on python


### Data 

To be continued...

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - a Jupyter notebook with the analysis of the data, interpretation and visualization.  

## Results
